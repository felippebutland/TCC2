\noindent Felippe Butland  \textbf{DOCUMENT SUBMISSION APPLICATION PROTOTYPE MODELED WITH C4 MODEL, USING MICRO-SERVICES ARCHITECTURE AND MESSAGING}. 2024. Undergraduate Thesis – Computer Science, Universidade Comunitária da Região de Chapecó, Chapecó, 2024.\\

\noindent This work describes the development of a document submission prototype application using a microservices architecture, messaging, and the C4 Model for modeling. The chosen architecture aims to provide modularity and scalability, addressing the needs of corporate applications and the reality of startups, which often hesitate to invest in software architects due to cost constraints. The solution was developed with separate microservices for login, registration, and document submission, with communication via messaging, creating an efficient and resilient data traffic system.
Benchmark tests demonstrated that the application can handle a satisfactory volume of requests, although the segmentation into microservices may introduce latency, especially in multi-region environments. The conclusion is that a well-planned and documented architecture, even with limited resources, allows for the development of scalable and maintainable applications. This work serves as a reference for startups and small companies seeking efficiency and long-term sustainability.
